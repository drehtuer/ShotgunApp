# Status

What has been done and how it turned out. Newest first. Entries keep the parts
that went wrong - a bug someone hit and fixed is worth more to the next person
than a clean summary that hides it.

See [`TODO.md`](TODO.md) for what is still open.

## Current state

**Built, verified on the phone, and released.** All four screens work, the draw
history and settings persist, and seven rounds of device feedback settled the
timing, the reveal, the dim level and the haptics. `v0.1.0` is published and the
documentation site is live. What is left is a fourth draw mode and polish.

## 2026-09-08 — HAPTICS is the only switch

A decision, made against what the last change recorded as deliberate.

Fixing [#39](https://github.com/drehtuer/ShotgunApp/issues/39) established that
Android takes a short, simple vibration for touch feedback and drops it on a
phone with *Touch feedback* switched off. The result buzzes were cut into steps
to get past that; **the tick was deliberately left to be dropped**, on the
argument that a per-finger tick really is feedback for touching and belongs to
the system's setting.

Overruled, and rightly: it made the app's own toggle mean two different things
on two phones - buzzes but no ticks on one, both on the other - with nothing on
screen to explain the difference. HAPTICS on now gives ticks **and** buzzes;
HAPTICS off gives neither.

The tick goes through the same `spread`, so it leaves as `[3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3]`:
seven steps, 12 ms of buzz, gaps of nothing between the pieces. Identical to the
hand, invisible to the classifier.

### Verified on the phone

A finger landed on the draw surface by `adb shell input tap`, and the history
agrees:

```
23:20:15 | finished | usage: UNKNOWN |
played: [3ms@1.00, 0ms, 3ms@1.00, 0ms, 3ms@1.00, 0ms, 3ms@1.00]
```

Before this it read `ignored_for_settings | usage: TOUCH`, which is the same
line the starter buzz used to have.

**A checking mistake worth keeping:** the first two attempts looked like the
tick had not fired at all, because `grep shotgun | tail -1` returns the last
line *in the file*, and `dumpsys` groups vibrations by usage - `UNKNOWN` is
printed before `TOUCH`, so a working tick lands in the middle of the dump and a
dropped one at the end. The check was wrong, not the app, and it looked exactly
like the bug it was meant to catch.

---

## 2026-09-08 — Coverage, second pass: the draw surface, piece by piece

**Line coverage 86.6% → 93.0%, branch 70.5% → 76.3%, 181 tests → 207.**
Excluding generated Room sources, as Codecov counts it: **87.3% → 94.6%** line.
`DrawScreen` alone went **35% → 84%**.

### The surface's pieces are `internal` now, and that is the whole trick

The first pass concluded the draw surface could not be covered on the JVM
because pointer injection does not reach it. That was true and beside the point:
the surface cannot be *driven*, but its pieces can be *rendered*, each with the
state it would have had mid-draw.

`EdgeGlow`, `FingerRing`, `Hint`, `Refusal`, `RevealBar` and `DrawMode.label`
changed from `private` to `internal` - the only production change in this pass,
and no behaviour with it. Eleven tests then render a ring for every role a draw
can give a finger: an order ring showing its rank, a teams ring showing its
letter and the word TEAM, a ring whose turn has not come showing nothing at all,
and a lifted ring still carrying its answer - the rule that a label sits beside
the ring while the finger is down and slides into it when the finger lifts.

Two Robolectric traps cost a cycle each here, and both are the kind that read as
a broken assertion rather than a broken test:

- **A `Box` that wraps its content clips every ring out of view.** The rings
  place themselves by absolute offset, so the host has to fill the screen or the
  nodes exist and report "not displayed".
- **Robolectric's default screen is 320x470dp.** A ring at phone-sized
  coordinates lands off it, and a label drawn *beside* a ring near the top edge
  goes off it upwards.

### Back, which is where the worst bug lived

Seven tests on the navigation graph, all of which end by asserting a screen is
still on display - "did not crash" is not the property, "is not blank" is. They
cover back from every destination, back twice from a stack one deep (the pop
that used to empty the graph and leave a live, blank window), and `popSafely`
directly: false at the start destination, true behind it.

The one test that could not be written is the double tap. Compose's test
framework settles between clicks, so the first tap navigates and the second
finds its node gone - "the node is no longer in the tree", which is the guard
working and not something an assertion can say. Testing `popSafely` directly is
what replaced it.

### The rest

The stepper at its floor (the minus greyed rather than live and inert - a bug
this shipped with once), the mode motifs for all three modes, the reveal-timing
pills both ways, and a teams record with **no** team count, which is a row from
a build that did not store one and must read as something rather than crash the
screen that plots history.

### Verified on the phone

The visibility change is behaviour-neutral, but it is in the draw surface's
file, so the build went on the Pixel: **all three modes still track touch and
draw**. Cheap to check, and the one change nobody should take on trust.

### Still uncovered, and now the list is short

- **The pointer loop and the countdown's frame loop** in `DrawScreen` - 42
  lines. Nothing on the JVM can drive them; `app/src/androidTest/` does, on the
  phone.
- **`ShotgunMark`'s canvas.** Robolectric lays out but does not rasterise, so a
  `Canvas` draw lambda never runs.
- **Room's generated open delegate**, excluded from Codecov as generated code.

---

## 2026-09-08 — Coverage: the data layer, the view model and the window

**Line coverage 64.3% → 86.6%, branch 58.8% → 70.5%, 134 tests → 181.** As
Codecov reports it - generated Room sources excluded - **73.2% → 87.3%** line.
Both figures are given because they differ, and the second is the one the badge
shows.

No production code changed. Everything below was already shipped and working;
none of it was checked by anything.

### What had no tests at all

| Area | Was | Why it mattered |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RoomDrawHistory` + the DAO | 0% | The winners query joins two tables and orders by a column in the other one. No compiler checks SQL. |
| `ShotgunDatabase` | 0% | The real, file-backed open path - and there is deliberately no destructive-migration fallback, so an open that goes wrong takes the history with it. |
| `SettingsRepository` | 0% | `SettingsTest` covered what a stored preference *means*, never that a write lands. |
| `ShotgunViewModel` | 0% | `recordDraw` decides who won and where the fingers were, as a fraction of the surface. Both are written to the database and can never be recomputed. |
| `DimScreen` / `dimTarget` | 0% | Two wrong answers shipped before this one - a fixed level made an already-dim phone *brighter*. |
| `MainActivity` | 0% | Nothing covered the app actually starting. |

47 new tests across seven files. The ones worth naming:

- **The winners query is order-sensitive, so the test inserts out of order** -
  newest draw last - which is the only way to tell "ordered by the joined
  draw's timestamp" from "in insertion order".
- **Pruning is tested through the cascade**: the oldest draw is evicted and its
  points must go with it, or orphans accumulate for the life of the install.
- **`recordDraw` is tested per mode**, because who "won" differs in each -
  starter by id, order by rank 1, teams not at all - and against a degenerate
  surface, where positions must collapse to the centre rather than divide by
  zero.
- **Dim mode is tested for the failure it shipped with**: dimming a dim screen
  must not raise it, and must never blank it.

### Two traps, one of which crashes the compiler

**A test in `ui.components` cannot use `@Rule`.** The app has a `Rule()`
composable - the 2px line the design is built from - and in that package the
name also has to serve as JUnit's annotation. It does not produce an error. It
crashes the Kotlin backend outright:

```
Backend Internal error: Exception during IR lowering
  The root cause java.lang.NullPointerException was thrown at:
  JvmAnnotationImplementationTransformer$AnnotationPropertyImplementor
```

- naming only the file, no line, no symbol. It took a bisect of one test file
to find. `ComponentRenderTest` now lives one package up **and** aliases the
import, so either half would do and nobody has to rediscover it.

**Compose's pointer injection does not reach the composable under
Robolectric.** Two attempts - freezing the clock and pumping frames, then
letting it auto-advance - both landed zero rings from a `down()` that works on
the phone. Advancing `System.currentTimeMillis` with `ShadowSystemClock` did not
help, because nothing was tracking pointers to begin with. So the draw
surface's touch paths stay device-only, which is where they were already, and
`DrawScreen`'s 35% is not a gap anyone should try to close on the JVM.

### What is still uncovered, deliberately

- **`DrawScreen`, 166 lines.** The multi-touch surface. Its decisions live in
  `ringSpec`, which is pure and tested; what remains is drawing and pointer
  plumbing, covered by `app/src/androidTest/` on the phone.
- **Room's generated open delegate**, the schema-creation half. Excluded from
  Codecov as generated code, and a test for it would be a test of Room.
- **`ShotgunMark`'s canvas.** Robolectric lays composables out but does not
  rasterise them, so a `Canvas` draw lambda never runs. Only a real screen can
  cover it, and only an eye can judge it.

## 2026-09-08 — The starter had no buzz ([#39](https://github.com/drehtuer/ShotgunApp/issues/39))

Reported from the phone: with HAPTICS on, order and teams buzz when the result
lands and **starter does not**.

### It was never played — Android dropped it before the vibrator saw it

The three modes share one code path, so nothing mode-specific could swallow the
call, and reading the code only said the effect handed to the vibrator was
different: `createWaveform([0, 90])` for starter against `[0, 90, 60, 90]` for
the other two. **Two theories were wrong before the phone settled it**, and both
were plausible enough to ship:

1. *The single-step waveform is the odd shape out* — so send a one-shot instead.
2. *A 90 ms buzz is too short to survive several hands damping the phone* — so
   pad it and raise the amplitude.

`dumpsys vibrator_manager` keeps every vibration the device has been asked for,
with a status. It showed something neither theory predicted: **the app's own
finger tick was logged under `usage: TOUCH` and `ignored_for_settings`**, and
in three days of history there was not one `[0, 90]` entry — the starter buzz
had never reached the vibrator at all.

The app calls `Vibrator.vibrate(effect)` with no `VibrationAttributes`, so the
usage is `UNKNOWN` and the framework *guesses* one. Two probes through
`cmd vibrator_manager -u 0`, which sends as `UNKNOWN` from the shell, pinned the
rule:

| Effect | Steps | Duration | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[0, 400]` | 2 | 400 ms | ignored, re-classified `TOUCH` |
| `[0, 30, 0, 30]` | 4 | 60 ms | played, stayed `UNKNOWN` |

**It is the step count, not the duration.** An unknown vibration of three steps
or fewer is taken for haptic feedback, and this phone has *Touch feedback*
switched off in Android's Vibration & haptics settings, so it is dropped. The
double buzz has four steps and survived by accident; the starter's two never
stood a chance. The second theory's fix — padding to 200 ms — was built,
installed, and **failed on the phone exactly as the first would have**: still
two steps, still `TOUCH`, still ignored.

### What changed

`Haptics.spread` cuts a short pattern into more steps than the heuristic
accepts, separating the pieces with **zero-length** gaps so the vibrator plays
them back to back. The starter's `[90]` goes out as `[23, 0, 23, 0, 22, 0, 22]`:
seven steps, 90 ms of buzz, no silence in it. What the hand feels is unchanged;
only what the framework counts is.

That also caught a regression the rewrite had introduced. Writing the patterns
as `design.md` writes them — `[90, 60, 90]`, on-durations first — dropped the
old leading zero and took the double buzz from four steps to **three**, which
would have silenced order and teams too. `spread` covers every result pattern,
and a test asserts the step count for all three modes rather than for the one
that was reported.

### Verified on the phone, twice, and objectively

The failed attempt and the fix were both installed as **release** builds over
the top of the existing one - the phone carries the released app, not a debug
build, and the release key is local, so the draw history and settings survived
each install. `adb install -r` of a debug APK would have needed an uninstall.

- Starter draw, after the fix: felt, and the history agrees —
  `finished | usage: UNKNOWN | played: [23ms@1.00, 0ms, 23ms@1.00, 0ms, 22ms@1.00, 0ms, 22ms@1.00]`.
- **Order and teams re-checked on the phone**, because the split changed their
  step list too — both still buzz, and unchanged to the hand. Worth the second
  draw: this branch had already broken them once, silently, on the way past.
- Nine unit tests under Robolectric assert what the app actually sends the
  vibrator: the step count for every mode, that splitting preserves the buzzing
  and the silence exactly, and that a pattern with enough steps is left alone.
  124 unit tests became 134.
- `assembleDebug lint` clean, `assembleRelease` builds.

### Found on the way: the finger tick is off on this phone

The tick is a single 12 ms step, so it is classified as touch feedback and
dropped for the same reason — **on a phone with Touch feedback off, HAPTICS on
gives the result buzzes but no per-finger tick.** Left that way deliberately:
the tick *is* feedback for touching and belongs to the system's setting, while
the result is the app's answer and belongs to the app's toggle. Written down in
[`design.md`](design.md#the-finger-tick-follows-the-system-setting) so it is a
decision rather than a surprise, and on [`TODO.md`](TODO.md) as a question
someone may want answered differently.

### Lesson

**"The code paths are identical, so the difference must be in the effect" was
right, and still produced two wrong fixes.** Neither was testable on the JVM:
Robolectric records what the app *asks* for, and the app asked correctly every
time. The device kept the answer in a log nobody had looked at - the fix took
minutes once `dumpsys vibrator_manager` was read, after an hour of reasoning
about actuators and waveform shapes.

Gradle ran in the `shotgun-dev` image against the devcontainer's own volumes,
because the WSL2 host still has no JDK - the recipe, and the two ways it fails,
are now in
[`build-environment.md`](build-environment.md#building-in-the-devcontainer-image-from-outside-the-devcontainer).

## 2026-09-07 — Release 0.1.2

`appVersion` 0.1.1 → 0.1.2, so `versionCode` derives to **102**. One value
changed; the tag has to match it or `release.yml` refuses the build.

Everything since 0.1.1, in the order it landed:

- **The palette is bound to the design export.** `DesignTokenTest` reads the
  nine `--pp-*` tokens out of `Shotgun.dc.html` at test time, so a re-export
  that changes a colour fails the build rather than disagreeing quietly.
- **The hardware finger limit is documented.** The Pixel 10a's digitizer
  reports ten simultaneous contacts; the app adds no cap of its own, and
  deliberately shows no finger count, because it cannot read one.
- **The fairness field is rasterised off the main thread**, keeping the
  previous bitmap up until the new one is ready.
- **Rank labels slide into the ring when a finger lifts**, which is the only
  placement guaranteed to be readable and on screen.
- **The suspense churn is dropped** - decided against rather than left open.
- **Licensed GPL-2.0-or-later**, the "or later" resolving the incompatibility
  with the Apache-2.0 dependencies.
- **Coverage went 17% to 68%**, mostly by measuring what was already tested:
  Robolectric covers the screens on the JVM, and `ringSpec` moved the ring
  styling rules out of a composable into testable code.
- **A real bug fixed**, found by a new test: `HeatField.density` allocated its
  array before validating the dimensions, so a negative width threw from the
  line written to prevent it.
- Devcontainer JDK path corrected, a `connect-android-device` skill added, and
  Wi-Fi debugging's random connect port handled by a `discover` subcommand.
- README badges, and a Codecov badge that now reads 68%.

### Cutting it

`release.yml` fires on the tag alone, refuses to build without
`RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64` - an immutable release of unsigned artifacts would
burn the version number for good - and attaches the APK and AAB to a *draft*,
publishing only once the upload finished.

---

## 2026-09-07 — Coverage reporting: Robolectric, and three silent failures

Codecov read 16.9%. **It now reads about 64%** - line coverage 16.3% → 63.8%,
branch 24.9% → 56.3%, 68 tests → 124. Nothing about the app got much safer in
the process; most of the gap was measurement.

### The CI emulator was the wrong answer, and podsilo already said so

The first attempt was a CI job booting an emulator to run the 31 existing
instrumented tests. It failed three times - a device profile the runner's SDK
does not have, then a framework that was not up when the action reached it -
and it was the wrong idea regardless.

`podsilo`'s `ci.yml` forbids exactly this, in capitals, with a reason worth
repeating: a runner has no device, so such a job can only be skipped, fail, or
boot an emulator, and *an emulator agreeing with Robolectric is what let three
of that project's worst bugs through*. Its `--device=/dev/kvm` is the
devcontainer, which this repository already had, identically. The emulator that
"works" there is the local one.

Job removed. `enableAndroidTestCoverage` reverted to off, so nothing
instruments an APK any more.

### Robolectric, configured the way podsilo configures it

`sdk=34` pinned in `robolectric.properties` (it ships no framework jar for this
module's `targetSdk` of 37), `isIncludeAndroidResources = true`, and the Compose
test artifacts on the unit-test classpath. 16 new screen and navigation tests.

The device set in `androidTest/` is untouched and still runs on the phone. It
covers what neither Robolectric nor an emulator can: multi-touch, real haptics,
how the countdown feels.

### Three failures that a green build would have hidden

Worth writing down, because each looked like success:

1. **Two of the first screen tests were wrong about the app, not the app about
   itself.** `TEAMS` matches two nodes on the home screen - the mode card *and*
   the stepper's label - and the settings screen scrolls, so `COUNTDOWN` and the
   version sit below the fold. Fixed by matching unique subtitles and by
   `performScrollTo`, which also proves those rows are reachable.

2. **The Robolectric tests passed while measuring nothing.** 119 tests green,
   every screen still at 0%. Robolectric loads application classes through its
   own sandbox classloader; they arrive with no source location, and JaCoCo
   skips those by default. `isIncludeNoLocationClasses = true` is the fix. Had
   the build status been the only check, this would have been reported as a win
   that had not happened.

3. **The fix for (2) could not be applied.** `Extension of type
   'JacocoTaskExtension' does not exist` - AGP's `enableUnitTestCoverage` runs
   JaCoCo but never applies the JaCoCo *plugin*. Naming `jacoco` in
   `plugins { }` is what makes the extension exist. That failure at least was
   loud.

### Where the coverage sits

| | Line coverage |
| --- | --- |
| `HomeScreen` | 100% |
| `SettingsScreen` | 96% |
| `ResultScreen` | 93% |
| `ShotgunNavHost` | 89% |
| `Stepper`, `ModeMotif`, `Theme`, `Type`, `Color` | 95-100% |
| `DrawScreen` | 36% |

`DrawScreen` is the multi-touch surface and stays low on purpose - its decisions
were moved out into `ringSpec`, which is pure and unit-tested, so what is left
there is drawing. What remains uncovered otherwise is `ShotgunViewModel`,
`MainActivity`, `Haptics` and `DimMode`: an Android lifecycle and two hardware
services.

### Verified on the phone

A full multi-finger draw was run after the `ringSpec` extraction and the rings
render correctly - ranks, the fade by rank, and the label sliding in on lift.
That was the last thing outstanding: the extraction moved the styling rules out
of the composable, and unit tests pin the rules, but only the phone can show
that the pixels still agree.

---

## 2026-09-07 — Relicensed GPL-2.0-or-later, and Codecov switched on

### The licence

Changed from GPL-2.0-only to **GPL-2.0-or-later**, which settles the conflict
recorded a few entries down: the app's dependencies are all Apache-2.0, which
the FSF holds incompatible with GPLv2, but *is* compatible with GPLv3. The "or
later" clause lets a recipient take the work under GPLv3 terms, where the
conflict does not arise.

The change is one clause in the notice, not a new licence file. `LICENSE` still
holds the GPLv2 text, because that is what "version 2 or later" points at - the
grant lives in the notice, and licence texts are not edited. `SPDX-License-Identifier:
GPL-2.0-or-later` is stated in the README for the machine-readable form.

**The licence badge had to stop being the live one.** GitHub detects the licence
by reading `LICENSE`, and that file is the GPLv2 text, so
`img.shields.io/github/license` can only ever report *GPL-2.0*. That is not
wrong, but it is not the licence either - or-later is a distinct SPDX
identifier, and the difference is the entire point of this change. Swapped for a
static badge reading `GPL-2.0-or-later`. The tradeoff is the usual one: it is
accurate now and cannot notice if the licence changes later, so it has to be
edited by hand if it ever does.

The dependency note in the README is rewritten from *"here is an unresolved
problem"* to *"here is why the licence says or later"* - same facts, now an
explanation rather than a warning. The decision is off `TODO.md`.

### Codecov

The `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret was added, so the upload step stops skipping. Before
this it was working correctly but doing nothing: CI logged *"No CODECOV_TOKEN -
skipping the upload"* and marked the step `skipped`, which was the intended
behaviour and also the reason the badge read *unknown*.

---

## 2026-09-07 — Coverage: the gaps, a bug they found, and Codecov

Branch coverage was measured, then the gaps filled. **The logic layer went from
80.9% to 97.3%** (114/141 to 143/147 branches); 68 tests became 91.

The overall figure moved 16.2% → 20.4%, and that number is close to meaningless:
it counts Compose UI, navigation and Room's generated DAO, none of which a JVM
test can reach. Every covered branch in the app is in the logic layer, which is
the split `architecture.md` intends, so the per-layer figure is the one now
written down.

### A test found a real bug

`HeatField.density` allocated before it validated:

```kotlin
val cells = FloatArray(width * height)                        // -5 * 40 = -200
if (points.isEmpty() || width <= 0 || height <= 0) return cells
```

The guard checks `width <= 0` **after** the allocation that a negative width
already blew up - `NegativeArraySizeException`, from a line written specifically
to prevent it. Dead defensive code, and exactly the sort a coverage gap hides.
Guard moved above the allocation.

Not reachable from `ResultScreen` today, since the width is a constant and the
height is coerced to at least 1. It was still wrong.

### What was added

- **`DrawEngine`** - the early returns: an unknown pointer id lifting or moving,
  `isRevealed` before any draw, a latecomer pressing mid-reveal, `revealNext`
  with nothing to reveal, `progress` when idle and when settled.
- **`HeatField`** - degenerate input: zero and negative dimensions, points
  entirely off the grid, an empty ramp, a single-stop ramp, values past both
  ends, and two stops sharing a position (the divide-by-zero span).
- **Settings** - a stored-but-unparseable theme or timing name, `haptics`/`dim`
  stored as `false` rather than absent, and the countdown floor.

### One refactor, for one branch

`stepCountdown` resolved the legacy `countdown_seconds` key inside a DataStore
`edit` block, so the migration could not be reached without a `Context`. Pulled
out as `steppedCountdown(stored, legacySeconds, steps)`, a pure function, and
tested there. That path runs once per upgrade and never again - the kind nobody
exercises by hand.

### Four branches left uncovered, deliberately

Unreachable through the public API rather than untested:

- `DrawEngine:212` - the single-finger draw. `draw()` only runs from `tick()`
  during `COUNTING`, which needs two fingers, and dropping below two returns to
  `IDLE`. `shuffled.size <= 1` cannot happen.
- `DrawEngine:176` - `revealNext` finding a null outcome. Only `draw()` sets
  `REVEALING`, and it sets the outcome first.
- `HeatField:93` - an inner loop whose body always runs for valid input.

Reaching them would mean widening visibility or contorting a test, which buys a
percentage point and costs the meaning of the number.

### Codecov

CI now runs `createDebugUnitTestCoverageReport` alongside the tests (the
coverage task depends on the test task, so nothing runs twice), uploads the
report as an artifact, and sends it to Codecov, which hosts the README badge.

**The badge reads *unknown* until a `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret exists** - see
[`build-environment.md`](build-environment.md#codecov). The upload is
*skipped* rather than failed when the token is absent, because a fork's pull
request cannot read secrets and must not go red for it.

Worth keeping: the skip condition lives in a preceding `run` step rather than
in the upload step's own `if`, because **a step's own `env:` is not in scope
for its own condition**. The first draft had it inline and would have evaluated
an empty string every time.

---

## 2026-09-07 — GPLv2

`LICENSE` added, taken verbatim from GitHub's canonical text (`gh api
/licenses/gpl-2.0`) rather than retyped - 18,093 bytes, preamble through the
appendix, checked for all thirteen clauses, *NO WARRANTY* and *END OF TERMS*.
The licence text itself is never edited, so the copyright notice lives in the
README instead.

README gains a licence badge - the live GitHub one, which reads the repository's
detected licence, so it says *not specified* until this merges and *GPL-2.0*
after - and a *Licence* section carrying the copyright line and the standard
notice.

**The boilerplate is GPL-2.0-only, not -or-later.** The first draft used the
GPL appendix's usual wording, *"either version 2 of the License, or (at your
option) any later version"* - which is the **or-later** grant, not what was
asked for. Caught before committing and cut back to *"version 2 of the
License"*. Worth knowing the appendix offers both and the difference is one
clause, because it is exactly the clause that matters below.

### The part that is not resolved

**GPLv2 is incompatible with the Apache-2.0 dependencies this app is built
on.** Every runtime dependency - AndroidX, Compose, Room, DataStore, Kotlin and
kotlinx - is Apache License 2.0, whose patent-termination clause the FSF treats
as an added restriction GPLv2 does not permit. Apache 2.0 is compatible with
GPLv3, so the usual fixes are **GPL-2.0-or-later** (a one-line change, and the
one that ends the conflict most cheaply) or GPLv3.

GPLv2 was asked for and GPLv2 is what was applied; the conflict is recorded in
[`TODO.md`](TODO.md) under *Decisions needed* with the three options, and noted
in the README next to the licence. It is not an obstacle while nobody else
redistributes the app, but it should be settled before anyone forks or ships
it.

Per-file licence headers were **not** added. They are conventional for GPL
projects but would touch every source file, and the licence was the ask.

## 2026-09-07 — README badges

Six badges above the title: the four workflows (PR, Code scanning,
Documentation, Release), the latest release version, and Dependabot.

Each was fetched before being committed rather than trusted to the usual URL
shape - all four workflow badges report `passing`, and the release badge
resolves to `v0.1.1`.

Two details worth keeping:

- **`?branch=main` only on the two workflows that run on `main`.** `pr.yml` and
  `codeql.yml` take it. `docs.yml` and `release.yml` fire on a `v*` tag, so their
  runs sit on the tag ref, not `main` - pinning the branch would have shown them
  as *no status*. Both were checked with and without.
- **The Dependabot badge is static, and honestly so.** Dependabot publishes no
  status endpoint, so nothing can report whether it last ran or what it found.
  The badge says `enabled` and links to
  [`.github/dependabot.yml`](https://github.com/drehtuer/ShotgunApp/blob/main/.github/dependabot.yml),
  which is the claim it can actually support. It cannot go stale on its own, so
  if that config is ever removed the badge has to go with it.

Badge URLs are absolute, so they work both on GitHub and on the Jekyll site,
which renders this README unchanged.

### Found, not fixed

**There is no `LICENSE` file**, and GitHub reports the repository's licence as
none - which is why there is no licence badge. For a public repository that
means default copyright: nobody may reuse the code, which may or may not be
intended. Left alone, because picking a licence is a decision rather than a
documentation fix. Logged in [`TODO.md`](TODO.md).

## 2026-09-07 — Rank labels slide into the ring when the finger lifts

Closes the last of the "true for the hands it has been tried with" items, by
changing the rule rather than improving the guess.

### The problem the old placement could not solve

A label drawn at the ring's centre is under the fingertip that made it. So it
was drawn above the ring, flipping below near the top edge - and that flip was
the *only* condition ever checked. It asks whether the label fits on screen,
never whether the space is actually free.

It cannot ask. The app has a contact point and nothing else: no arm direction,
no grouping of fingers into hands, no idea who owns which. A player reaching
across from the far side has their palm over exactly the space above their
fingertip, and nothing flips, because the finger is nowhere near the top edge.

### The rule now

**Beside the ring while the finger is down, sliding to the ring's centre over
240 ms once it lifts.** Per finger, not per hand - each label moves as its own
finger comes off.

This works because the rings already outlive the fingers that drew them:
`DrawEngine.onUp` deliberately holds `REVEALED` when the last hand leaves, since
you have to lift to see what was under your own fingers. Lifting was already the
moment you read the answer; the label now moves somewhere guaranteed legible
when you do. A ring's centre is a point that was touched, so it is on screen by
construction - which also covers a label that would otherwise sit off the edge.

Verified on the phone.

### A documentation bug fell out of it

`design.md`'s state table said `revealed` is left when **"all fingers lifted"**.
That is exactly what the engine refuses to do, and had it been true this feature
could not exist - the rings would vanish on lift. `REVEALED` ends when the next
draw starts (a finger lands while none are down) or the surface is left.

Worth recording as a near miss: the table was read while designing the change,
and it described behaviour opposite to the code. The row is corrected and the
rule now also stated in prose under *Behaviour*, where it is harder to skim past.

## 2026-09-07 — Fairness field off the main thread, churn dropped

Two items off the open list, one closed by building it and one by deciding not
to.

### The fairness field no longer rasterises during composition

`FairnessField` computed the density grid, coloured it and allocated the bitmap
inside a `remember` block - so on the main thread, during composition, every
time the history or the palette changed. `HeatField` splats a kernel per
retained winner and up to 2,000 draws are kept, so the cost grows exactly as the
screen becomes worth opening.

Now a `produceState` on `Dispatchers.Default`, keyed on the winners, the palette
and the panel size. **The previous bitmap stays on screen until the new one
arrives**, so a recompute shows a stale field rather than flashing an empty
panel - which is what `null`-then-recompute would have done.

Keying on `colors` rather than `colors.isDark` came out of the rewrite: `PPColors`
is a data class, so structural equality already covers the ramp, and the narrower
key would have missed a palette change that kept the same `isDark`.

Verified on the phone in both palettes - the field renders, the ramp inverts
correctly between light and dark, nothing in the crash buffer. The theme switch
is itself the proof that the off-thread recompute path works, since it forces
one.

No new unit test: nothing new is computable in isolation. The maths in
`HeatField` was not touched and its tests still cover it; what changed is which
thread calls it, which the JVM tests cannot see.

### The suspense churn animation is dropped, not deferred

The export specifies every ring pulsing (`scale .94 ↔ 1.06`) during `suspense`.
It was never built, and it is now **decided against** rather than left open:
revealing the players one at a time is already the suspense, and pulsing the
rings between steps overhypes a result that takes a second to read.

Recorded in [`design.md`](design.md) as a deliberate divergence from the export,
which still shows the churn - behaviour is this document's call, and the export
is never hand-edited. It will stay a divergence until the Design project is
updated upstream.

### Building needed a container

The host still has no JDK, so `assembleDebug lint testDebugUnitTest` ran inside
the devcontainer image instead - repo mounted, SDK into a scratch directory,
Gradle as the host uid so nothing came back root-owned. Clean: 68 tests, no
failures, lint "No issues found", no compiler warnings. Worth knowing the option
exists when the workspace container is not available.

---

## 2026-09-07 — The hardware finger limit, the JDK, and a device skill

Started as a question - is the ten-finger ceiling the hardware or the app? - and
turned into three fixes.

### The limit is the hardware, and it is ten, not nine

Confirmed on the phone. The Pixel 10a's digitizer reports `ABS_MT_SLOT ... max 9`
via `getevent -pl`, and `dumpsys input` agrees with `Slot: min=0, max=9`.

**The nine is an off-by-one.** Slots are zero-based, so `max 9` is slots 0-9 -
**ten** simultaneous contacts. That misreading is exactly why the number is now
written down in [`design.md`](design.md#how-many-fingers) with the raw output
beside it.

The app adds no cap of its own, as designed: a ten-finger PLAYER ORDER draw
recorded ten `draw_points` rows, ranks 1-10, one winner, empty crash buffer.

Reading the count back out of the database was the fiddly part. Room runs in
**WAL mode**, so pulling `shotgun.db` alone gives `no such table: draws` - the
schema is still in the `-wal` file. All three files have to come across. There is
no `sqlite3` on the device either, so the query runs locally in Python. Both
traps are now in the skill.

### A settings row was asked for, then dropped - deliberately

The plan was to show the hardware maximum in Settings, above the version. It
cannot be done honestly. The app is sandboxed out of `/proc/bus/input/devices`
and `/dev/input/*` (`Permission denied` under its uid), and the only public API,
the `PackageManager` feature tier, tops out at `multitouch.jazzhand` = *"5 or
more"*. On a panel that does ten it would report five.

So nothing was added. Showing the tier understates the hardware; showing a
running high-water mark dresses an observation up as a hardware fact. The
reasoning is recorded in [`design.md`](design.md#why-this-is-not-shown-in-the-app)
so it does not get re-proposed.

### The JDK: the devcontainer was fine, its config was not

`./gradlew installDebug` failed with *"Toolchain installation ... does not
provide the required capabilities: `[JAVA_COMPILER]`"* - a JRE with no `javac`.

**The devcontainer was not the culprit.** That session was running on the WSL2
host, which has only `openjdk-21-jre`. The base image ships a full JDK 21,
verified by running it: `javac 21.0.12.1` at `/usr/lib/jvm/msopenjdk-current`.

Chasing it did turn up a real defect. `devcontainer.json` pointed the Java
extension at `/usr/local/sdkman/candidates/java/current`, which **does not exist
in this image** - a leftover from an older base image that used SDKMAN. Gradle
never noticed because it reads `JAVA_HOME`, so the breakage was invisible and
editor-only. Path corrected, and the Dockerfile now asserts `javac` at image
build so a base image that dropped the JDK fails there instead of at someone's
first build. Image rebuilt to confirm.

### Wireless debugging needed a port scan

`connect-device.sh` documented `:5555`, which is wrong for Android 11+ - the
connect port is random (43227 this time). `adb mdns services` found nothing,
because mDNS is link-local and does not cross the container's NAT, so the
documented recipe had no way to succeed.

Added a `discover` subcommand that scans 30000-50000 and tries each open port.
It also handles the trap that cost time here: the **pairing port stays open**
afterwards and looks like a candidate, but connecting to it leaves the device
`offline`. Tested end to end against the phone - two open ports found, pairing
port skipped, connected.

Wrapped the whole flow in a
[`connect-android-device`](https://github.com/drehtuer/ShotgunApp/blob/main/.claude/skills/connect-android-device/SKILL.md)
skill, the first in this repo.

### Not verified

The devcontainer changes were checked by building the image and running `javac`
in it, not by rebuilding the workspace container - so the corrected editor path
is reasoned from the image contents, not observed in VS Code. Gradle and the
test suite were never run this session: the host has no JDK, so the ten-finger
check used the existing `Shotgun-debug-0.1.1.apk`, first confirming no source
file was newer than it.

## 2026-09-06 — Binding the palette to the design export

**Outcome: done, and the first version of it was useless in a way that only a
mutation test could show.**

`PPColors` opens by saying it is "transcribed verbatim from the `--pp-*` custom
properties in the design export". **Nothing checked that.** `PPColorsTest`
asserts invariants - ink differs from ground, the palettes invert, the heat ramp
runs cold to hot - and every one of them holds just as well for the *wrong*
colours. Since the export is regenerated from Claude Design and has twice come
back with decisions reverted, the gap was not hypothetical.

`DesignTokenTest` now reads the export at test time and asserts all nine tokens
against both palettes, plus two things worth having:

- **The token set must be exactly the nine the app maps.** A token added by a
  re-export is a design decision that has not reached the app, and silence is
  how it would stay that way.
- **The export must agree with itself.** It writes each palette twice - once for
  the system preference, once for an explicit `data-theme` - and those can
  drift apart, after which the app matches one and not the other.

### The test passed, and caught nothing

Three deliberate mutations of the export - a changed accent, an added token, the
two dark blocks disagreeing - **all three passed**, in about a second each.

`testDebugUnitTest` was `UP-TO-DATE`. Gradle fingerprints a task from its
declared inputs, and a file read at runtime is invisible to that, so changing
*only* the export - which is precisely what a re-export does - did not re-run
the one test written to catch it. It would have sat green in CI forever.

The export is declared as a task input now, and the same three mutations fail,
naming the token and both values:

```
--pp-accent disagrees between the export and the dark palette
  expected:<#FFFF0000> but was:<#FFFF563C>
```

**Lesson: a test that has never failed has not been shown to work.** This one
was written, run, and passing while detecting nothing at all - and the reason
was not in the test.

### Where this leaves Claude Design

`/design-sync` does not apply here, and it is worth writing down why rather than
re-deciding it: it syncs design-*system* projects, pushing a local component
library up to one. This repo *consumes* a design system - Modernist, bound as
`design/_ds/modernist-f7022762-…/`, the only project id anywhere in the export -
and the app is Kotlin, not a component library.

So the integration is a contract, not a tool: **the export is never hand-edited**
- now a rule in `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - visuals go upstream, behaviour lives in
`design.md`, and the palette half of that is enforced by a test rather than by
good intentions. Two hand-edits made before the rule still need mirroring
upstream; they are in `TODO.md`.

`/design-login`, which would authorize the sync tool, is **not available in this
environment** either - and it is a Claude Code command rather than anything in
the Claude Design UI, which is worth saying because it is the wrong place to
look for it. Neither matters: nothing here depends on it. `DesignTokenTest`
reads a file already in the repository, so it needs no account, no login and no
network. `build-environment.md` records the re-export procedure that replaces
all of it.

---

## 2026-09-06 — v0.1.1, and one number fewer to get wrong

**Outcome: a patch release, and `versionCode` taken out of human hands.**

Everything since `v0.1.0` was infrastructure, documentation and three Lint
fixes - the artifact naming, the Jekyll site, the security policy, Dependabot
and CodeQL. **No behaviour changed**, so a patch bump rather than a minor one.

The release itself only needed `appVersion`. But `versionCode` was still a
hand-written `1`, and it is the number Android compares to decide whether an
APK is an update: **a release that repeats or lowers it cannot be installed over
the one before**, and an immutable release cannot be corrected afterwards. It is
also exactly the kind of number that gets forgotten, because nothing local
fails when it is wrong - the build succeeds, the tests pass, and the damage only
appears on someone else's phone.

So it is derived now - `major * 10000 + minor * 100 + patch`, giving `101` for
`0.1.1` - and cutting a release means changing one value. Verified against the
built APK rather than the source: `aapt2 dump badging` reports
`versionCode='101' versionName='0.1.1'`.

That is the third guard on this path, after the signature check and the
tag-versus-`appVersion` check. All three exist because a published release
cannot be taken back, so the only place to catch a mistake is before the tag.

### The release worked; the docs deploy was rejected

`Shotgun-0.1.1.apk` and `Shotgun-0.1.1.aab`, signed and published. The
documentation workflow **built the site and then failed to deploy it**:

> Tag "v0.1.1" is not allowed to deploy to github-pages due to environment
> protection rules.

The `github-pages` environment ships allowing the **default branch only**, and
moving the trigger to the `v*` tag put the deploy on a ref it does not accept.
The first successful publish had been a `workflow_dispatch` from `main`, which
is exactly why this went unnoticed - **the working path and the release path
were never the same path.**

The environment now carries a `v*` tag policy alongside `main`, and the failed
job was re-run against the artifact it had already built. Site live, and it
carries this entry.

**Lesson, and it is the same one as the `--user` flag on the Jekyll container:**
verifying through a slightly different route than the real one verifies a
slightly different thing. Both failures were invisible until the real path ran
for the first time.

---

## 2026-09-06 — The keystore backup is only half a backup

**Outcome: a wrong assumption caught before it mattered.**

The release keystore was backed up to a password manager as a file, on the
understanding that the keystores have no password. **They do** - 24 characters
each - so the file alone cannot be opened, and the backup as it stands would not
restore anything.

Checked rather than assumed, and worth the two commands:

```
keytool -list -keystore keystore/release.keystore -storepass ""
  -> keystore password was incorrect
keytool -list -keystore keystore/release.keystore -storepass "<real>"
  -> shotgun-release, PrivateKeyEntry
```

Within each keystore the store and key passwords are the same value; debug and
release differ from each other. The release key is 4096-bit RSA, `SHA384withRSA`,
valid until 2056 - so expiry is not the risk.

**Both are now backed up together**, which closes the last item on the list
that could not be recovered from. Until this, the only readable copy of the
password was `keystore.properties` on the build machine - a GitHub secret is
write-only by design and never counted as a copy - so the password, not the
file, was the single point of failure. `build-environment.md` records what a
backup has to contain, and that the two have to be updated in the same pass if
the key is ever rotated.

**Worth keeping as a habit:** the backup was believed complete before it was.
Nothing failed, and nothing would have failed until the day the machine died -
which is the property that makes backups worth testing rather than assuming. Two
`keytool` commands settled it.

Merge queue is dropped from the open list. The rulesets API rejected the rule at
the type level however it was sent, the `main` ruleset never carried one, and it
is not worth more archaeology - stacked PRs chained by hand have worked
throughout.

---

## 2026-09-06 — Polish: Lint clean, and a decision about how many fingers

**Outcome: done. Lint is at zero findings, and "how many players" has an answer
that is not a number this app invented.**

The five informational Lint findings were each a real thing rather than noise,
so all five were fixed rather than suppressed:

- `AutoboxingStateCreation` - the countdown's `progress` was a `Float` in a
  generic state box, boxed on **every frame** of the countdown. Now
  `mutableFloatStateOf`.
- `UseOfNonLambdaOffsetOverload` - the settings toggle knob is animated, and the
  non-lambda `offset` recomposed the whole `Box` per frame instead of only
  re-laying it out.
- `ModifierParameter` - `ShotgunMark` took `size` before `modifier`, so a
  caller could not pass a modifier positionally the way every other composable
  here allows.
- `UnusedResources` - `ic_launcher_round.xml` was **byte-identical** to
  `ic_launcher.xml`. Both are adaptive icons, which the launcher already masks
  to whatever shape it wants, so the round variant was a duplicate that could
  drift. Deleted rather than wired up with `android:roundIcon`.
- `NewerVersionAvailable` - coroutines 1.10.2 → 1.11.0.

### How many fingers

The design said "the screen is the limit", which is not a limit. The answer is
that **the app should not invent one**: Android reports a device-dependent
maximum number of simultaneous pointers, commonly ten, and past that a finger
produces no pointer at all. A cap in the app would only be a second, lower
limit that then had to be explained.

Ten is also the practical ceiling for the thing itself - two hands, one phone -
so the behaviour is pinned there by three tests: ten fingers each get a distinct
rank, ten across three teams are dealt round robin with sizes differing by at
most one, and lifting one of ten leaves the other nine undisturbed. 64 unit
tests now.

---

## 2026-09-06 — Security policy, Dependabot and code scanning

**Outcome: done. Most of the value was in deciding what *not* to automate.**

`SECURITY.md`, a Dependabot configuration and a CodeQL workflow, plus the
repository settings that make them mean anything: private vulnerability
reporting, Dependabot alerts and security updates, all now on. Secret scanning
and push protection were already enabled.

**The policy is bounded by what the app can actually do**, which is little: one
permission, `VIBRATE`; **no `INTERNET` permission at all**, so nothing can leave
the device even by mistake; and a local database holding finger positions and
nothing else. Stating that plainly is more useful to a reporter than a page of
process, and it is checkable - the manifest is three lines.

The part worth spelling out is signing material. **A leaked release key is the
one unrecoverable failure here**: Android identifies an app by its signature, so
whoever holds the key can ship an "update" to everyone who installed it. So the
policy says explicitly that finding a keystore or key password anywhere in the
repository *is* the vulnerability.

**Dependabot deliberately does not raise AGP or the Gradle wrapper.** They move
together with `compileSdk` and the Kotlin version - and AGP 9 removed the
`kotlin-android` plugin - so an automated bump breaks the build rather than
updating it. AndroidX and Compose are grouped into one PR each, because they are
released in step and a per-artifact PR could not pass CI on its own. Both are
cases where the default configuration produces PRs that are guaranteed to be
red, which teaches people to ignore Dependabot.

**CodeQL scans the workflows as well as the Kotlin**, because that is where the
signing keys and the release path live - least visible, and with immutable
releases least recoverable. It runs weekly as well as per PR so new queries
reach existing code. It is deliberately **not** a required check: findings are
advisory, and a required one blocks unrelated merges on an untriaged alert.

**`build-mode: none` does not work for Kotlin**, which was worth finding out
the noisy way. The first run completed a dependency scan, reported
`BUILD SUCCESSFUL`, and then failed at the finalize step with "CodeQL could not
process any code written in Java/Kotlin" - an empty database rather than an
error at the point of the mistake. Kotlin is extracted by the compiler as it
runs, so it needs `build-mode: manual` and a real `assembleDebug`. The `actions`
language has nothing to build and keeps `none`, so the two now differ by
design.

That was not the end of it. With a real build the run failed **the same way**,
and for a completely different reason: `39 actionable tasks: 22 executed, 17
from cache`. **CodeQL extracts Kotlin by tracing the compiler as it runs**, so
tasks served from the Gradle build cache contribute nothing - `BUILD
SUCCESSFUL`, empty database, identical error message. Caching is now off for
that job.

**Lesson: "could not process any code" is a symptom, not a cause.** It says the
extractor saw nothing, which a wrong build mode and a warm cache produce
identically. The thing that distinguished them was the task summary, not the
error.

**Two settings would not enable.** `secret_scanning_non_provider_patterns` and
`secret_scanning_validity_checks` stay `disabled` after a `PATCH` the API
accepts without error - no message, no failure, just no effect. Recorded in
`TODO.md` rather than assumed to have worked.

---

## 2026-09-06 — First release, and the documentation site

**Outcome: `v0.1.0` published and the site live - after both workflows turned
out to be broken in ways only building their output could show.**

Neither had ever run. Building the site locally, with the same container image
CI uses, found what reading them had not.

**Every link on the site was broken.** All 25 cross-document links pointed at
`.md` files that do not exist on the site; a `sed` pass rewrote a few prefixes
and left the rest. Now GitHub's own Jekyll against a root `_config.yml`, which
fixes it at the source - `jekyll-relative-links` resolves them as a matter of
course. Links to files Jekyll does not publish are absolute GitHub URLs, so they
work in the repository *and* on the site.

**The Mermaid diagrams would have been served as source code.** GitHub renders
Mermaid in its *repository* Markdown view - which is where they had been checked
- but **Pages does not**. All five would have appeared as walls of `graph TD`
text. The layout now loads Mermaid and unwraps Kramdown's markup, with blocks
hidden until it has run.

**A release would have been published unsigned, permanently.** `release.yml`
treated a missing key as normal and published unsigned artifacts with a warning
- written back when the key was deliberately not on GitHub. Since a published
release is immutable, that would have burned the version number for good. A
missing key now fails the run, `apksigner verify` confirms the signature on the
artifact rather than inferring it from the secret existing, and artifacts are
attached to a **draft** which is published only once the upload succeeds.

**The docs workflow would never have fired.** It triggered on
`release: published`, and `release.yml` publishes the release itself using the
default `GITHUB_TOKEN` - and **an event raised by that token does not start
another workflow run**. The site would silently never have published. Both
workflows now watch the `v*` tag, which a person pushes.

### The one thing local testing hid

The release worked first time: signed APK and AAB, `apksigner` confirming
`CN=Shotgun!, OU=Release, O=drehtuer`. The docs run failed on
`mkdir: cannot create directory '_site/api': Permission denied`.
`jekyll-build-pages` is a **container action running as root**, so `_site`
belongs to root while the job does not.

Local testing had hidden this precisely: the container had been run with
`--user "$(id -u)"` to keep the output writable, which made the local run
*differ from CI in the one way that mattered*. **A convenience added to avoid
cleaning up root-owned files removed the failure being tested for.** The site is
now assembled in a fresh directory - copying *out* of `_site` needs only read -
and the fix was verified by reproducing the failure first.

### Named release artifacts

`app-release.apk` says neither what it is nor which version. The builds now
produce `Shotgun-<version>.apk` and `Shotgun-debug-<version>.apk`, and the
release workflow renames the bundle to match. `outputFileName` is not on the
public `VariantOutput` interface, so this goes through `VariantOutputImpl`; the
cast is checked, not forced.

That introduced a new way to publish something unfixable - the name comes from
`appVersion` in the build file, not the tag, so a `v0.2.0` tag on an unchanged
`appVersion` would put `Shotgun-0.1.0.apk` inside a `v0.2.0` release. The
workflow now refuses to run when the two disagree. **`v0.1.0` keeps the old
names**; it is immutable.

### Documentation that had drifted

Found by checking claims against the code rather than reading for sense:
`STATUS.md` still opened with "skeleton + theme … the four screens are stubs";
`TODO.md` carried the removed "+1 s per further finger" countdown and a dim
level that had been wrong twice; `design.md` gave the old 2 s countdown default
and a 600 ms suspense; `build.gradle.kts` and `release.yml` both still said the
release key was not on GitHub.

## 2026-09-06 — Device testing, and the blank screen

**Outcome: a run of real bugs, all found by hands on glass rather than by
tests.** Installed on the target Pixel 10a over Wi-Fi.

The blank screen is worth recording in full, because three plausible
explanations were wrong before the right one.

Reported as: pick a mode, press back immediately, and the app draws nothing
until it is restarted. It could not be reproduced synthetically - six back-press
timings, rapid double taps, tap-plus-two-backs and the edge-swipe gesture all
behaved. Two suspects were ruled out with evidence rather than argument: the
glow uses `BlurMaskFilter`, historically unsupported under hardware
acceleration, but forcing a countdown produced no render errors; and the
brightness override was measured, not guessed.

What settled it was catching the app *in* the state. `dumpsys` showed the
activity resumed with no crash, and an accessibility dump showed **three nodes**
- bare window chrome, no Compose content. The navigation graph had lost its
destination.

Reproduced in a test: **popping more often than the stack is deep empties the
graph**, and an empty graph renders nothing. Two pops racing each other is
enough - a button tapped twice, or a tap arriving with the back gesture. Every
exit now goes through `popSafely()`, and back handling lives in one place.

**Lesson: an unreproducible bug is usually a wrong model of the failure, not a
rare one.** Catching the app in the broken state and dumping what it actually
contained took minutes; guessing at causes took much longer.

Also fixed from device testing: labels drawn under the very fingers they
belonged to; the countdown appearing to ignore its setting, which was the
stepper losing taps to an asynchronous read; both timers restarted forever by
the jitter of a resting hand; and dim mode, set absolutely, making a dim screen
*brighter*.

## 2026-09-06 — The four screens

**Outcome: done, across five PRs.** Each screen's logic was pushed out of the
composables into plain functions, so the parts that can be tested without
hardware are.

**Settings and dim mode.** Dim lowers `screenBrightness` on the app's own window
and restores it on the way out - deliberately not the system-wide setting, which
would leave a phone dimmed after the app closed. Applied in `MainActivity`,
because brightness is an app-wide property, not a property of the screen that
happens to toggle it. Verified by changing three settings, force-stopping and
reopening.

**Result and the fairness field.** The density maths lives in a plain
`HeatField` with no Android types, so it is unit-tested. That mattered more than
usual: the screen makes a claim about fairness, and "it looks about right" is
not a check of a claim. The test worth keeping is **a corner win registering as
hot as a centre win** - without edge mirroring, corners read as permanently
cold and the screen would libel the draw as unfair. Verified by seeding 241
draws into the real on-device database and looking at it.

Two things that cost time: `gradle connectedAndroidTest` **uninstalls the app
afterwards**, deleting its database, so seeding through it shows an empty screen
- `adb shell am instrument` leaves the data in place; and `--tests` is not a
valid filter there, it is
`-Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.class=`.

**Draw surface.** The rules live in a plain `DrawEngine` with no Android in it -
time passed in, randomness injected - so the countdown, the teams guard, the
reveal rules and who wins are unit-tested. The one thing that cannot be tested
without hardware is multi-touch, so everything else was made testable without
it. **Multi-touch turned out partly testable anyway**: the emulator cannot
inject a genuine multi-pointer gesture, but Compose's own pointer injection can.

**Home.** The team count lives in the ViewModel rather than in settings,
because the design keeps it beside the draw. Two bugs only visible on a device:
the vertical SETTINGS tab wrapped mid-word - "SETTIN / GS", since Compose has no
`writing-mode` and the first fix measured the rotated label against the tab's
width; and the stepper's minus stayed at full contrast at the floor, looking
live while doing nothing.

**Signing, build variants and persistence.** `debug` carries full debug data,
`release` is R8-minified and symbol-stripped - 1.2 MB against 12 MB. Two
deliberate omissions in `debug`, both easy to add by reflex and both wrong here:
no `applicationIdSuffix` (it would break every documented adb command) and no
`enableAndroidTestCoverage` (it instruments the APK, and this app is judged on
touch and countdown timing).

The integration risk was KSP: it versions independently and AGP 9 supplies its
own Kotlin, so the two could easily have disagreed. KSP 2.3.11 against Kotlin
2.4.10 under AGP 9 was checked before anything was built on top of it.

Positions are normalised to 0..1 **at write time**. That is the one thing in
this layer that can corrupt data silently - raw pixels would skew the fairness
field, and the damage stays invisible until a screen size changes.
`fallbackToDestructiveMigration` is deliberately **not** set: history is the
whole point of the fairness field, and wiping it on a schema change would make
that screen lie.

## 2026-09-06 — Rename to Shotgun!, and a documentation audit

**Outcome: done.**

The app became **Shotgun!**: re-exported design, a logo in `assets/logo/`,
package and `applicationId` moved to `de.drehtuer.shotgun`. The `PP*` prefix on
the theme types was **kept deliberately** - it mirrors the `--pp-*` token names
the design still uses, so a colour can be traced between design and code by
name.

**The re-export had been branched from the original design rather than the
edited copy here, so it silently reverted decisions made the day before**:
haptics went back to a single buzz, and the toggle copy to its old text. Those
decisions still stand, so they were re-applied. Second time hand-edits have been
at risk - see `TODO.md`.

The audit that followed found more wrong than missing. `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
opened by pointing at `design/Player Picker.dc.html`, **deleted in the rename**;
it survived because the path was line-wrapped across two lines, so the search
and replace never matched. `README.md`'s layout tree still named
`PlayerPickerTheme` and `PlayerPickerNavHost`, for the same class of reason -
inside a fenced code block.

**Lesson: a line-wrapped path and a fenced code block both defeat a naive search
and replace.** After a rename, grep for the old *words*, not the old path.

## 2026-09-05 — Keep the screen awake during a draw

**Outcome: done and verified on device.**

The screen could dim or lock mid-draw. Android resets its idle timer on touch
*events*, and a finger held still through the countdown produces none - so the
one moment the screen must stay on is exactly the moment the system counts as
idle. Fixed with `FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON`, scoped to the draw surface so it cannot
leak into the other screens.

Verified with `dumpsys window` across the whole navigation graph. The first
attempt reported a **false negative**: `grep -A3` after the window line stopped
short of the `fl=` line it needed, about five lines in.

## 2026-09-05 — Specification decisions

**Outcome: done. All three open questions answered; no code changed yet.**

SOUND removed as not needed. DIM MODE defined as lowering screen brightness like
an alarm clock, explicitly *not* a palette change. Haptics redefined from a
single buzz to a `12 ms` tick per finger down plus a stronger result buzz - the
tick deliberately does **not** fire on drag or lift, because dragging is
repositioning, not joining, and buzzing on it would contradict the rule the hint
text teaches. Draw history moved to a database so the heatmap plots real draws.

Dim mode and the database cannot be expressed in a browser prototype, which
forced a question about which document wins. Resolved by splitting authority:
**the export owns visuals, `docs/design.md` owns behaviour.**

## 2026-09-05 — Toolchain, documentation set and CI

**Outcome: done, and retargeting forced a toolchain jump.**

The target device was confirmed as a **Pixel 10a on Android 17 (API 37)**.
Raising `compileSdk` to 36 failed immediately - current AndroidX requires
compileSdk 37 and AGP 9.1+ - so the whole toolchain moved: AGP 8.7.3 → 9.4.0,
Gradle 8.11.1 → 9.7.1, Kotlin 2.0.21 → 2.4.10, compileSdk/targetSdk 35 → 37.

**AGP 9 has built-in Kotlin support: the `kotlin-android` plugin now fails the
build outright and had to be removed.** Recorded in several places because it is
easy to re-add by reflex.

The emulator has no `pixel_10a` profile; `pixel_9a` on an API 37 image is the
closest match, and reported `ro.build.version.release=17`.

Also added: `docs/design.md` as a translation of the export - not a replacement,
since the `.dc.html` holds the executable state machine - `build-environment.md`,
this file, `TODO.md`, the first 11 unit tests, and the two workflows. Neither
workflow could run on its own PR, since workflows must exist on `main` first.

Translating the design surfaced two gaps: **`sound` and `dim` appeared in the
settings with no behaviour defined anywhere.** Both were answered the same day.

## 2026-09-05 — Android skeleton and Modernist theme

**Outcome: done.**

The Gradle project, the theme transcribed from the design's `--pp-*` tokens, the
navigation shell and stub screens, and the devcontainer.

**Two bugs found only by running it:** system bar icons followed `uiMode` rather
than the app's palette, so the clock was unreadable when the theme was
overridden; and the settings dividers used a hardcoded height instead of the
row's intrinsic height.

Several devcontainer problems also only appeared under use: `/dev/kvm` arrives
owned by a nonexistent group, and AVDs and the debug keystore vanished on
rebuild until they were moved into named volumes.

## 2026-09-05 — Design export imported

**Outcome: done.**

The repository began as an export from a Claude Design project, with no commits
on `main`. `/design-sync` does not apply - this repo is a *consumer* of a design
system, not the source of one.
